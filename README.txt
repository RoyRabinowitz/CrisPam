CrisPam README

CrisPam is a pythonic tool for identifying novel PAMs generated by SNPs (SNP-derived PAMs) for allele-specific targeting by varying CRISPR/Cas systems. 
It is ideal for researchers willing to target a particular mutation or assessing the specific-targeting potential of several mutations. 
CrisPam is built as a webtool in which you may insert DNA sequences and obtain analysis of which CRISPR/Cas systems may best fit to specifically target the point mutation of your choice. However, for analysing multiple SNPs or customize the PAM sequences, you may use the CrisPam script. In order to do so, please download the following files and open them from the same directory:
Main.py
casDBFile.py
seqAnalysis.py
seqTools.py
seqType.py

The casDBFile.py file contains the PAM sequences and their corresponding CRISPR/Cas systems and can be edited to customize PAM sequences.
DBLOCATION defines the directory of the SNPs file (xml format)
Run Main.py to obtain a CSV file with your results.
